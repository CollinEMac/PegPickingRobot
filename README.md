# PegPickingRobot
A senior project involving a robot, 2 red pegs, 2 yellow pegs, boxes, and a maze

This robot was submitted in the 2016 IEEE robotics competition.

I've also included some of the presentations and images that we took as part of the course. 
I omitted a lot of the test scripts in our original files because they weren't very usefu and were pretty much terrible.
